## The Software Stack

All applicable services will align to these technology stacks. Currently, some
services are in the process of migration to these stacks.

### The Stack

- Drash: The framework used to write our HTTP servers. We have our own
  pre-configured base that can be rolled out for rapid development.
- Mongo: The database backend database used and hosted by Amethyst.
- Deno: The driving force of our backend. With native JSON support, it works
  strongly with Mongo and Drash.

### Additional Tooling

- Bash: The obvious for use with Linux to power our services we provide.
- Docker: We use docker to containerize and isolate out applications among our
  stack.
- Git: Used as version control for GitHub.
- TypeScript: The strict coding standard we follow to ensure that our
  applications are sturdy and fault resistent.
